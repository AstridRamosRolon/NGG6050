%% Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?

    % Yes, if the p-value is p<0.05, it suggests that the positive test 
    % is "statistically significant". 
    % 
    % H:  When the test gets back a positive it means the person is infected
    %     and when it gets a negative when the person is not infected.
    % H0: The result of the test results negative or positive regardless of
    %     the status of infection.
    %
    % If the p-value is pâ‰¥0.05 there is not enough evidence, so we reject the
    % hypothesis (H) and accept the null hypothesis (H0). In other words, it 
    % doesn't strongly support the claim that the person is infected or not 
    % infected. Conversly, if the p-value is p<0.05 we reject the H0 and 
    % accept the H. Meaning, that there is evidence to say that the positive
    % or negative results reflects the status of infection. The p-value alone 
    % doesn't tell you the probability of being infected; it tells you the 
    % probability of observing the test result if the null hypothesis were true.

%% Exercise #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive test, that person is infected?

% Parameters
num_samples = 1000;

specificity = 0.90;  % Specificity of the test (true negative rate)

    % Store the result in the array
